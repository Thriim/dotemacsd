;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The version on GITHUB is the latest STABLE version.  It may (will)
;; lag the development copy, from:
;;
;;   https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/hide-region%2b
;;
;; The function `hide-region-hide' hides the region. You can hide many
;; different regions and they will be "marked" by two configurable
;; strings (so that you know where the hidden text is).
;;
;; The hidden regions are pushed on a kind of hide-region \"ring".
;;
;; The function `hide-region-unhide' "unhides" one region, starting
;; with the last one hidden.
;;
;; The best is to try it out. Test on the following:
;;
;; Test region 1
;; Test region 2
;; Test region 3
;;
;; If you are annoyed by the text getting "stuck" inside the hidden
;; regions, call the function `hide-region-setup-keybindings' to setup
;; local keybindings to a couple of functions trying to be smart and
;; guessing if the point is inside a hidden region and if so, move out
;; of it in the correct direction.
;;
;;; Version history
;;
;; Version 1.0.2
;;
;; * Updated defvar to defvar-local and removed associated
;;   (make-variable-buffer-local) thoughout.
;;
;; Version 1.0.1
;;
;; * Seems that the getting-stuck problem have disappeared since Emacs
;; 21.3 was released, so no need anymore for the extra movement
;; commands.
;;
;; * Added the intangible property to the overlays because that seemed
;; to remove a minor getting-stuck problem (the overlay "ate" one
;; keystroke) when navigating around an overlay.  Adding the intangible
;; property makes it impossible to navigate into the overlay.
;;
;; * Added custom option to propertize the overlay markers for greater
;; visibility.
;;
;; * Minor code cleanup
;;
;;
;;; Bugs
;;
;; Probably many, but none that I know of.  Comments and suggestions
;; are welcome!

;; Modify by corwin
;;  return new overlay from `hide-region-hide'
;;  display hidden text as an overlay
;;  add text properties for "handles" (pre/postfix)
;;   as setup to make them clickable soonish
;;  move "handles" face out to a defcustom
;;  defvar to deflocal
;;  rm :type from defc immediately following defg
;;  docstring and misc
;; Modify by yupeng
;; set variable `hide-region-overlays' as buffer local
;; Add to function:
;; `hide-region-unhide-below'
;; unhide a region just below the point
;;  `hide-region-unhide-all'
;;  unhide all the region in the current buffer
;; `hide-region-toggle'
;; toggle all the gide region in the current buffer
